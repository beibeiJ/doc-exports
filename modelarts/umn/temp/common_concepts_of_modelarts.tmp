<h4 class="sectiontitle">ExeML</h4><p id="modelarts_01_0005__en-us_topic_0284258737_en-us_topic_0172727212_p1742114895014">ExeML is the process of automating model design, parameter tuning, and model training, model compression, and model deployment with the labeled data. The process is code-free and does not require developers to have experience in model development. A model can be built in three steps: labeling data, training a model, and deploying the model.</p>

<h4 class="sectiontitle">Inference</h4><p id="modelarts_01_0005__en-us_topic_0284258737_en-us_topic_0172727212_p82120415344">Inference is the process of deriving a new judgment from a known judgment according to a certain strategy. In AI, machines simulate human intelligence, and complete inference based on neural networks.</p>

<h4 class="sectiontitle">Real-Time Inference</h4><p id="modelarts_01_0005__en-us_topic_0284258737_en-us_topic_0172727212_p94093435513">Real-time inference specifies a web service that provides an inference result for each inference request.</p>

<h4 class="sectiontitle">Batch Inference</h4><p id="modelarts_01_0005__en-us_topic_0284258737_en-us_topic_0172727212_p775310192210">Batch inference specifies a batch job that processes batch data for inference.</p>

<h4 class="sectiontitle">Resource Pool</h4><p id="modelarts_01_0005__en-us_topic_0284258737_en-us_topic_0172727212_p2501125451716">ModelArts provides large-scale computing clusters for model development, training, and deployment. There are two types of resource pools: public resource pool and dedicated resource pool. The public resource pool is provided by default. Dedicated resource pools are created separately and used exclusively.</p>
